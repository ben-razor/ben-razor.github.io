I was searching for a platform to use to demonstrate recent projects that I have been working on.

GitHub pages seems to fit the bill as a backend isn't needed and it will be simple
to deploy and best of all free.

GitHub pages uses a site generator called Jekyll by default. I've not used anything like this before
so it will add a new tool to the toolkit.

Jekyll offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
def show_some_love_to(who):
  print(f"I ♥ {who}")

show_some_love_to('Python')

# prints 'I ♥ Python' to STDOUT
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
